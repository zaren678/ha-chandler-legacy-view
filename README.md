# Chandler Legacy View Home Assistant Integration

The Chandler Legacy View project is a Home Assistant custom integration that
focuses on water system valves such as water softeners and filtration systems.
The integration listens for Bluetooth advertisements emitted by supported
valves, recognises them by their signatures, and surfaces their presence inside
Home Assistant as entities that can participate in automations or dashboards.

## Current capabilities

* Establishes a Home Assistant config entry via the UI (no YAML required).
* Watches for Bluetooth advertisements that match the expected Chandler valve
  signatures, including both the Bluetooth name prefixes and the Chandler
  manufacturer data identifier.
* Tracks multiple valves simultaneously by their Bluetooth address so each
  device is registered individually in Home Assistant.
* Creates binary sensor entities that indicate whether each recognised valve is
  currently available.
* Extracts the firmware version reported in the advertisement metadata and
  surfaces it as an entity attribute for troubleshooting and diagnostics.
* Classifies the advertisement payload to determine whether the valve reports
  as an Evb019 (firmware < 600) or Evb034 (firmware ≥ 600) and exposes the model
  via device information and entity state attributes.
* Polls authenticated EVB019 dashboard data for flow, capacity, cycle state,
  cycle timing, battery, and other operational sensors.
* Provides **Refresh Now** plus guarded **Regenerate Now** and
  **Next Regeneration Step** buttons. The integration refreshes valve state
  before sending the state-dependent command, so only the action valid for the
  current cycle state is available.

This repository currently focuses on the scaffolding required for discovery and
entity creation. Additional device metadata, richer entities, diagnostics, and
configuration options will follow as device details become available.

## Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/chandler_legacy_view` directory into your Home
   Assistant `custom_components` folder.
2. Restart Home Assistant to load the new integration.
3. In Home Assistant, navigate to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add
   Integration** and search for "Chandler Legacy View".
4. Complete the configuration flow to enable Bluetooth-based discovery of
   Chandler valves. The integration uses the factory default valve passcode
   (`1234`) automatically; per-valve overrides can be configured later from the
   integration options. Only one instance of the integration is required.

## Development

* `custom_components/chandler_legacy_view/discovery.py` implements the Bluetooth
  discovery logic.
* `custom_components/chandler_legacy_view/binary_sensor.py` defines the initial
  entity type exposed by the integration.
* Configuration flow strings are located in
  `custom_components/chandler_legacy_view/translations/en.json`.

Contributions are welcome! The goal is to expand the integration to expose the
valve state (e.g. service mode, regeneration cycles) and diagnostics as the
device protocol becomes better understood.
